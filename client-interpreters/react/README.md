# Overview

Bones React component is a simplistic Bones Interpreter which spits out React
code in the form of a String.  This is currently mostly for the proof of concept.

The entry point for this interpreter is the [CreateReactFiles](src/main/scala/com/bones/react/CreateReactFiles.scala)
which will create the content for index.html and index.js files.
